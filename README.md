# Emurgo Project - Fullstack Dapp

## Project Goal:
	To develop a frontend (React) and connect it to the backend (solidity smart contract) and allow users to post data to the blockchain and sign every transaction with Metamask. The smart contract will write messages to the blockchain and will also read data or saved messages from the blockchain.

Every function in the smart contract will be fully tested and the contract will be verified on etherscan for easy interaction.


## Development Tools:
	Ethereum, Solidity, Hardhat, Web3, Javascript (React), Alchemy, Etherscan, Chai, Metamask

## Development Features:
	Create a smart contract with Read and Write function.
	When a new message is added, the contract should emit an event.
	Test the functions in the contract to ensure that they are return valid data
	Verify the contract on Etherscan and be able to interact with the contract
	Develop the UI with ReactJs
	Add connect to metamask button
	Add a button to post a new message to the blockchain
	All transactions must be signed with metamask
	
Overall, this project will show how the frontend and smart contract can be connected and work together.
